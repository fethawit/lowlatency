lowlatency
==========

Low Latency is an osu!-esque rhythm game for Android. Like osu! the objective is to hit circles in time with the music.
Unlike osu! there are no beatmaps to worry about. Load the music on your device directly into the game. Low Latency's beat
detection algorithm does the work of analysing the music and generating a map behind the scenes.

Low Latency targets Android but runs just fine on the desktop as well.

Low Latency uses:
--LibGDX, a FOSS x-platform Java game framework
--MyID3 for Android, a port of the excellent MyID3 library
--lwbd, an extensible & extremely simple beat detection library
